I am a PhD student in Software Engineering at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) under [Crista Lopes](https://ics.uci.edu/~lopes/). My research focuses on program verification, LLM application, and LLM testing. Ensuring software correctness through verification, exploring innovative uses for LLMs, and establishing rigorous testing methodologies are crucial for advancing reliable and ethical AI technologies. 

I received B.S. in Agronomy and Computer Science at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at [Laboratory for Software Design](https://design.cs.iastate.edu/) with [Hridesh Rajan](https://hridesh.github.io/) and [Robert Dyer](https://cse.unl.edu/~rdyer/) on an ultra-large data mining project.
